**Weekly Build Update**


Within the next weekly builds at the weekend, we are adding the Motorola Moto Z (griffin) and Nubia Red Magic (nx609j) to our weekly build list.
Of course with Android 8.1! We do now also support 21 devices! 


 - The download links  will be : 
 --	[[griffin](http://dl.omnirom.org/griffin/)]
 --	[[nx609j](http://dl.omnirom.org/nx609j/)]

The device bringup for *griffin* is done by me (**samstone86**) and with a lot help from **Erfan Abdi**. I updated the kernel to the latest griffin release and were now running a 3.18.71 kernel.
For the *nx609j* our rockstars **maxwen**, **darkobas** and **kldoc** did an awesome job. The LED strip on the device backside got basic support for charging indicator (green pulse) and for notifications (blue pulse).

Have fun!	*The OmniROM Team.*
